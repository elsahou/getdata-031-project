## Subject
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Subjects are labeled 1:30 in tidydata.txt with the Activity that was performed and the mean value for each variable tested.

## Activity
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). 
These are listed in the tidydata.txt

## For the remaining variables use the key below to understand the variable names.
"XYZ" - 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
"Acc" - Accelerometer raw signals
"Gyro" - Gyroscope raw signals
"Time" - Time domain signals
"Freqency" - Frequency domain signals
"Body" - Body signals
"Gravity" - Gravity signals
"Jerk" - Jerk signals
"Mag" - Magnitude
